.
.TP
\fBformula_name\fR
The brew formula name\. Internally expanded into a list of Launchd job labels\.
.
.TP
\fBcom\.launchd\.job\.label[\.plist]\fR
The name of the Launchd job label\. Also the plist filename\. Useful when a formula has installed multiple launchd services (sub\-services)\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Launchr (aka brew\-launchd) is an extension to Homebrew to start and stop Launchd services\.
.
.P
The launchd service status of a brew formula is managed by symlinks\. When a formula is installed, any launchd plists are linked into \fI$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Library/LaunchDaemons\fR\. Later, when a service is started, those symlinks are redirected to the target LaunchDaemons folder (as per \-\-user / \-\-boot)\. Launchctl is then called to bring the service up/down\.
.
.P
If a running service is deleted or uninstalled, it should be stopped first with \fBbrew stop\fR\. Otherwise the launchd database will be left in a state which is inconsistent with the symlinks in \fI$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Library/LaunchDaemons\fR\. However Launchr has an auto clean feature to recover from such situations\.
.
.P
\fBSudo\fR is absolutely required to install boot\-time services\. The corresponding keg will be \fBchown \-R\'d\fR to \fBroot:wheel\fR\. This is a strict requirement of Apple\'s Launchd\. When the service is stopped, the keg is chown\'ed back to user ownership of the enclosing folder\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBstart\fR [\-\-user|\-\-boot] service,(s) \.\.\.

.
.TP
\fBstop\fR [\-\-user|\-\-boot] service,(s) \.\.\.
Stop launchd services\. Equivalent to launchctl unload \-w files\.\.\.
.
.TP
\fBrestart\fR [\-\-user|\-\-boot] service,(s) \.\.\.
Restart launchd services\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-user\fR
Start at user login\. Otherwise, the default setting will be used\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-boot\fR
Start at boot time\. Requires sudo / root privelidges\. Otherwise, the default setting will be used\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR [ service,(s) ] \.\.\.
Info for launchd services\. With no arguments, print info for all installed services\.
.
.TP
\fBclean\fR
Clean missing/broken launchd services\.
.
.TP
\fBdefault\fR { \-\-user | \-\-boot }
Set the default target for launchd services\. Defaults to \-\-user, which will start daemons at user login (ie via Loginwindow, not ssh)\. Whearas \-\-boot will ensure all services are set to start at boot time\. This option can be overriden on a case\-by\-case basis\.
